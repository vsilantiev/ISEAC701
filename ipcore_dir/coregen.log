WARNING:coreutil:928 - Unable to find 'xilinx.com:ip:fifo_generator:9.3' within

WARNING:sim - The IP FIFO Generator 9.3 does not exist within the repository,
   and cannot be recustomized or regenerated. It is not available in CoreGen
   14.2, and may have been removed or replaced. An alternative version of the IP
   exists within the repository. To generate FIFO Generator 9.3 please use a
   previous version of ISE in which this IP is available, or add the user
   repository which contains this IP.
WARNING:sim:991 - The project IP instance 'v7_eb_fifo_counted_resized' for IP
   'FIFO Generator v9.3' was generated with a different version of the IP than
   is currently in the IP Catalog. It was originally generated using IP with the
   packaged timestamp '2012-11-19+12:39'; the IP in the current catalog has a
   different packaged timestamp '1970-01-01+00:00'. This mismatch is due to
   changes made to the IP in the user repositories. It may affect some
   functionality of the IP, if there are differences between these two versions
   of the IP.
